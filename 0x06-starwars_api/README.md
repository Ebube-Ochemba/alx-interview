- [x] [0-starwars_characters.js](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-interview/blob/main/0x06-starwars_api/0-starwars_characters.js): Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:
  - The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: `3` = “Return of the Jedi”
  - Display one character name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the `/films/` endpoint
  - You must use the [Star wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/)
  - You must use the `request` module
