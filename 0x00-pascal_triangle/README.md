- [x] [0-pascal_triangle.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-interview/blob/main/0x00-pascal_triangle/0-pascal_triangle.py): A function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n`:
    - Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
    - You can assume `n` will be always an integer

> [0-main.py](./0-main.py): A test case for the program. Provided by Alx.
