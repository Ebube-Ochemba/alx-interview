# 0x08. Making Change

> This project was mock interview preparation.

## Summary

I revisited concepts like: Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Algorithmic Complexity, Problem-Solving Strategies, and Python Programming.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [] [0-making_change.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-interview/blob/main/0x08-making_change/0-making_change.py): Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.
- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
  - Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`
    - If `total` is `0` or less, return `0`
    - If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`
  - `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
  - The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`
  - You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
  - Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
