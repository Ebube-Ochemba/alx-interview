# Rotate 2D Matrix

> This project was mock interview preparation.

## Summary

I revisited Python concepts like: Matrix Representation in Python, In-place Operations, Matrix Transposition, Reversing Rows in a Matrix, and Nested Loops.

- [x] [0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-interview/blob/main/0x07-rotate_2d_matrix/0-rotate_2d_matrix.py): Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
  - Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
  - Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
  - You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
